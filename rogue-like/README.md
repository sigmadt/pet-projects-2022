# HW-roguelike-game

Hello fellas! This is my own implementation of **"PURPLE HAZE"** game  in classic roguelike genre.

Imagine that you are legendary Jimmy Hendrix and you are worried 
that there are a lot of haters and doubters around you. 
They critize your music, your lifestyle, even your haircut. Screw this and let's blow off steam playing this game!

**Attention!** Reduce your volume level or put on headphones â€“ you will be surprised to hear beautiful song.
